# AGENDER2.0

## Overview

AGENDER 2.0 (Advanced Gestalt ENgineering for Data Exploration and Research) is a project developed during a master's program in Computational Modeling and Simulation with a focus on Life Sciences at the Technische Universität Dresden. This project aims to explore the intricate relationship between acute stress and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) in daily life, accounting for the impact of physical activity.

The project combines advanced machine learning techniques and statistical analysis to analyze HRV data, aiming to provide insights into stress patterns in real-world settings. This interdisciplinary work is a blend of computational neuroscience, data science, and psychology, leveraging large-scale data analysis for impactful health-related discoveries.
